# Server-Side-Explorer
Server-Side Explorer is an interactive web application built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, designed to simulate and demonstrate various server-side concepts in a visually engaging way. It serves as an educational tool for students and developers to understand how server-side operations like request processing, logging, and response handling work.

The app includes dynamic components such as:

Request Simulator – to visualize how requests flow through a server.

Logs Viewer – to track and display simulated server logs in real-time.

Quiz Module – to test knowledge on server-side principles.

Code Viewer – with syntax highlighting using react-syntax-highlighter, enabling users to read and understand sample backend code in a readable format.

Built with a modular structure, responsive design, and modern tooling, Server-Side Explorer emphasizes clarity, performance, and developer experience. It also demonstrates best practices in component-based design, client-side routing, and utility-first CSS styling.

This project is ideal for:

Learners exploring server-side concepts.

Educators needing a visual aid to teach backend basics.

Developers experimenting with React + Vite stack.
